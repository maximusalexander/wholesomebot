okay so this is just a basic notes document to figure out how to make this mess work

load the bot (main)
    import everything
    get the prefix
    get the token
    do the status stuff
    onready: 
        printouts
        start status loop
    load cogs
        load datahandler first
        load the rest later
    main entry point

on message:
    check for keywords
        if keyword, extra points
    add points to their score, !!reorder scoreboard here!!
    if not exposed, change to exposed
    save data

on join/leave:
    go through each member in guild

timed events:
    specific time:
        infect user
        send message to user
        give them role

Saved Data:
    userdata - from userlogger - saved into members_data.json
        id
        name
        discriminator
        bot
        exposure status
        exposure score
        infected time
    guild data
        guild id
        guild name
        guild users list
    config - saved into .config
        prefix
        role
        channel(?)
    keywords - might need a class to add/remove keywords
        random keywords added to a list - saved into .keywords


scoreboards:
    - two scoreboards:
        1. board sorted by total score only
        2. same board, but delete infected members (for finding candidates. ) we'll call this secretboard.

User Infection Flow
    1. determine candidates
        - top three from scoreboard are eligible to be infected
            - these are weighted with funny numbers, but you're more likely to be infected if you're higher on the list
    2. apply infection: 
        - change exposure_status from exposed to infected. (this should never change from clean to infected.)
        - give user the infected role
        - give them some points
        - send dm, explain the game
